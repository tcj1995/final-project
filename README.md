### The dataset has numeric and literal data such as object begin data and cultural background. There are many different types of metadata in this dataset such as artist end data,artist display bio, department title, culture, the details of its artist and so on. These two types of metadata were into our eyes first because we found that there were couple noisy data. For instance, under the artist display bio information, the first object is "American, Delaware County, Pennsylvania 1794–1869 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", this is noisy because it has unnecessary duplication "Pennsylvania", the normal data should look like "American, East Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1818–1888". The other metadata is interesting because we found that there is an obviously wrong data. Under the artist end date information, there is an artist whose end date is 9999. The normal end date should not be later than 2019. There may be more wrong data about artists' end date.
